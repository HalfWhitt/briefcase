Briefcase now uses a private cache of Cookiecutter templates, rather than the shared ``~/.cookiecutters`` directory. You can reclaim disk space by deleting ``~/.cookiecutters/briefcase-*`` and ``~/.cookiecutter_replay/briefcase-*`` (or the entire ``~/.cookiecutters`` and ``~/.cookiecutter_replay`` folders if you are not using Cookiecutter for any other purposes).
